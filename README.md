## Overview

**Morph Net IP Flux** is a Python and Shell-based cybersecurity framework that leverages **Moving Target Defense (MTD)** to safeguard web servers and cloud systems from enumeration, reconnaissance, and targeted attacks. It achieves this by dynamically rotating public-facing IP addresses, deploying honeypots, and spoofing attacker reconnaissance through behavioral obfuscation.

---

## Motivation

Traditional IP-based protections are static and predictable, making them vulnerable to:
- Automated scanning
- Reconnaissance by APTs
- IP-blacklisting circumvention
- Reverse engineering and targeting

This project was built to **break the attacker's kill chain at the earliest possible phase** â€” reconnaissance.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic IP Rotation**: Randomly replaces active IP addresses at configurable intervals.
- **Honeypot Deployment**: Launches lightweight HTTP and SSH decoy services to mislead attackers.
- **TLS Certificate Rotation**: Auto-generates and rotates TLS certificates to defeat JA3 fingerprinting.
- **Cloudflare DNS API Integration**: Seamless DNS record updates.
- **Jitter-based Scheduler**: Obfuscates timing patterns to resist statistical detection.
- **Multi-log System**: Logs every event (IP change, honeypot hit, attacker behavior, etc.)
- **Pluggable Modules**: Modular architecture to plug in future network defenses.
