## Threat Modeling and Attack Surface Considerations

Overview

This document outlines the potential attack vectors, adversarial tactics, and corresponding mitigation strategies relevant to the implementation of our project:

"Moving Target Defense for Web Servers using Virtualized IP Rotation"

The primary goal is to demonstrate how dynamic IP rotation reduces reconnaissance efficacy and enumeration success, increasing the overall resilience of critical web infrastructure.

1. Passive Reconnaissance Detection

Threat:

Adversaries passively monitor IP address space to observe patterns in activity over time.

Risk:

IP switch intervals become predictable

Attackers correlate logs to identify server behavior

Mitigation:

Implement jittered/randomized IP rotation intervals

Introduce decoy (honeypot) traffic from unused IPs

Log false positives to mislead adversaries

2. Fingerprinting and Behavioral Correlation

Threat:

Even if IPs change, attackers can use fingerprinting tools to correlate server responses:

TLS certificate hashes

HTTP headers

Open port combinations

Mitigation:

Use ephemeral TLS certificates (e.g., short-lived Let's Encrypt certs)

Randomize HTTP response headers, server banners, or TCP packet timings

Consider rotating exposed ports dynamically

3. DNS Enumeration and TTL Analysis

Threat:

Attackers analyze DNS behavior for TTL patterns or use passive DNS tools to track changes.

Mitigation:

Use short TTLs for DNS records

Mask DNS exposure via fronted domains or CDNs

Regularly rotate A/AAAA records programmatically

4. Timing Attacks to Detect IP Rotation Logic

Threat:

Adversaries send regular pings/scans to estimate rotation frequency.

Mitigation:

Introduce irregular or probabilistic switching schedules

Include dead intervals (no IP assigned)

Run multiple IPs concurrently to obscure active paths

5. Identifying Real vs. Decoy IPs

Threat:

Attackers isolate the actual service-hosting IPs by monitoring traffic consistency and behavioral patterns.

Mitigation:

Use real cloned containers to host decoy services

Deploy honeypots (e.g., Cowrie, Dionaea) with similar responses

Load balance traffic across both real and fake IPs

6. Cloud Metadata and CIDR-based Detection

Threat:

Public cloud IPs often reveal provider-specific CIDR blocks or metadata.

Mitigation:

Use multi-cloud or edge providers to distribute the IP pool

Implement cloud provider obfuscation by masking services behind reverse proxies or CDNs

Conclusion

By strategically introducing unpredictability, misdirection, and behavioral obfuscation, this MTD framework offers industrial-scale defense for web applications.

This approach aligns with Zero Trust Architecture principles and is relevant for:

Government and defense systems

Financial and healthcare infrastructures

Cloud-native enterprises aiming to mitigate advanced persistent threats (APTs)

This threat model will be part of the project's technical documentation and serves to position our solution as a resilient, scalable, and forward-thinking security enhancement for modern infrastructure.
